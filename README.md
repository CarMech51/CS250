# CS250

In order to interpret needs of the consumer I create user storuies that then become workable items to complete. By creating a user story, the team gets the full sense of what need to be included in the project, and having multiple user stories allows the team to corectly estimate time and cost in order to deliver a complete product. 
How I approach developing a program is to use an agile  framework, start by getting a user story, break that into small workable sections, then complete each item, then work all finished item together. 
Being a good team member meens taking ownership of my part of the project, delivering a good complete product, and respecting other team men=mbers and staff.
